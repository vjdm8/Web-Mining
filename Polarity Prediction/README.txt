Create a python script that reads a file with reviews and predicts their polarity (0 for negative, 1 for positive). 

- Your script should train on the reviews_train.txt file included in this week's zip file.

- The script should read a file named "test.txt" that includes 1 review per line (no labels). The script should then predict the polarity of the reviews and write the predictions to a file called "out.txt". One prediction per line: 0 for negative, 1 for positive. 

- You can test your script on the reviews_test.txt that is included in this week's zip file. However, your final score will be determined on your accuracy on a separate file that you do not have access to.

- This is a team assignment 

- Name you script based on the username of one your team's members (e.g. tlappas.py). You can pick any member.

- Your script will be tested on the server. If it throws exceptions, it will not be considered.

- If your script takes more than 4 minutes to compete, it will not be considered.

- Best team gets 15, second team gets 10, third team gets 5.
